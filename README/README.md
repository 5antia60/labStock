For the project to work, the computer must have sql server installed... We use Microsoft sql management studio to prepare the database... When opening the management studio, we must create a database called "LabEstoque", and run the "scriptSQLServer" file for the tables to be generated, as shown in figure 1 and 2. After that, just check if the tables were created in the database, as shown in figure 3.
